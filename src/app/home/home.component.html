  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <p>I'm Hugo, a computer science graduate currently studying for a master's degree in computer graphics in Madrid (Spain).</p>

  <p>I'm currently employed in <a href="https://www.luca-d3.com/">LUCA</a>, Telefónica's data unit, creating large scale B2B insight applications using a wide range of technologies.</p>

  <p>
    Some of my previous jobs and roles include:
    <ul>
      <li>Recommendation engine improvements on movistar+ (Telefónica's video-on-demand service) using natural language processing</li>
      <li>Web developer in <a href="http://producthackers.es/">Product Hackers</a>, creating web apps, mobile apps, dashboards and chatbots</li>
      <li>Research work in natural language processing using Big Data technologies as part of the data lab at UEM (with a paper published)</li>
      <li>Research work in computer vision with the department of industrial engineering at UEM</li>
    </ul>

  <p>I mostly work using Golang, Python and Javascript (with React and Angular), but I enjoy many topics in computer science, such as crypto, OpenGL, DevOps, C++, continuous integration, Open Source Software, compilers, embedded programming, Vim, Git, retro gaming, emulation...</p>

  <p>I used to be part of UEM's robotics club. In 2016 we built a teleoperated rescue robot. I've never worked in a professional fashion in this field, but I had a lot of fun and was a great learning experience technically and in teamwork.</p>

  <p>I'd love to write more blog posts (when I find some spare time).</p>

  <p>Besides computer science, I also enjoy travelling and <a href="/photos">photography</a>!</p>
