  <h1>Hi!</h1>

  <p>I'm Hugo, a computer science graduate currently living in Madrid (Spain). I am now studying for a master's degree in computer graphics.</p>

  <p>I'm currently employed in <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/es/home">Telef√≥nica</a>, working on <a href="https://www.luca-d3.com/">LUCA</a> projects. I've previously worked on improving their video-on-demand (<a href="http://ver.movistarplus.es">movistar+</a>) recommendation engine.</p>

  <p>I also worked with Product Hackers, building web apps and chat bots using <a href="https://angular.io">Angular 2</a> and <a href="http://ionic.io/">Ionic 2</a> for a Spanish newspaper.</p>

  <p>I've also worked in research groups within my University on topics such as computer vision, robotics and natural language processing. Since 2016 I'm also a member of their Data Science Lab.</p>

  <p>I'm one of the members of my university's robotics club. Last year we built <a href="https://github.com/hugo19941994/robot">HRB</a>, a teleoperated rescue robot. <a href="http://projectbasedschool.universidadeuropea.es/informatica/noticias/noticias/Primer+premio+en+el+Laureate+Award+for+Excellence+in+Robotics+Engineering/2/22/221/11088">With it our team won the 2016 Laureate Awards for Excellence in Robotics Engineering</a>.</p>

  <p>Besides programming, I also enjoy travelling and photography!</p>
